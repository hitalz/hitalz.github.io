        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="about-paragraph">Twitter is an online news and social networking service where users post and interact with messages, called "tweets." These messages were originally restricted to 140 characters, but on November 7, 2017, the limit was doubled to 280 characters for all languages except Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Registered users can post tweets, but those who are unregistered can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface, Short Message Service (SMS) or mobile device application software ("app"). Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, United States, and has more than 25 offices around the world.</p>

        <p class="about-paragraph">Twitter was created in March 2006 by <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey" target="_blank">Jack Dorsey</a>, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)" target="_blank">Evan Williams</a> and launched in July of that year. The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity. In 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet". As of 2016, Twitter had more than 319 million monthly active users. On the day of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter proved to be the largest source of breaking news, with 40 million election-related tweets sent by 10 p.m. (Eastern Time) that day.</p>

          <li><strong>April 2007 – October 2008:</strong> Twitter grows rapidly under CEO Jack Dorsey, completing two funding rounds and launching official support for <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag" target="_blank">hashtags</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>October 2008 – October 2010:</strong> Jack Dorsey steps down, and Evan Williams takes over as CEO. Twitter raises money, gets celebrity endorsements and publicity, and continues to grow rapidly. The first tweet from space occurs during this period. Twitter also announces that it will start allowing for advertising in the form of <em>promoted tweets</em> – "ordinary tweets that businesses and individuals want to highlight to a wider group of users."</li>
          <li><strong>October 2010 – October 2013:</strong> Evan Williams steps down as CEO, and <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Costolo" target="_blank">Dick Costolo</a> takes over. The company starts making acquisitions, closes a $800 million Series G, puts its advertising plans to fruitions, launches site redesigns, and continues to grow.</li>
          <li><strong>October 2013 – present:</strong> Twitter announces plans and files relevant legal documents in October 2013 so as to go public. In November 2013, it has its <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering" target="_blank">initial public offering</a>. Post-IPO, the company's pace of acquisitions increases dramatically.</li>
          <li><strong>November 2014 – present:</strong> With the launch of features such as Instant Timeline, While You Were Away, Quality Filter, Curator, and Moments, Twitter diversifies beyond just being a reverse chronological stream of tweets by people you already follow. Rather, it seeks to more intelligently help people with the on-boarding process as well as helps seasoned users navigate through what might otherwise be a very messy feed.</li>
          <li><strong>July 2015 – present:</strong> Dick Costolo departs Twitter and Jack Dorsey assumes the role of interim CEO. Commentators note that the "founder's instincts" are influencing the product's new direction.</li>
